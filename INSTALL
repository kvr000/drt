--- Compiling

Run . ./senv.sh in root directory:

```
. ./senv.sh
```

In case you need to overwrite compiler or any other settings, use directory
etc/p/, insert appropriate file (named as the file in etc/) and modify the
settings.

Generate Makefile files (replace ../def/linux.txt with other file corresponding to your OS):

```
cd src/
dr_genmake ../def/linux.txt .
cd ../
```

Build:

```
make -C src/
```
